        <div class="text">
            <p>The Nelson College Environmental Committee was started in 2009 with one 
                simple goal: <strong>to increase the sustainability and aware of Nelson 
                College and its students</strong>. Although a very big goal, it 
                has been making great strides towards achieving it over the years since.</p>
            <p>Beyond 2009, the committee has expanded into the many different branches 
                of sustainability and environmental action. It has started recycling and
                tree planting initiatives and is looking at starting pest control and composting 
                initiatives in 2024. Committee members have also taken part in many 
                different environmental strikes, gatherings, and cross-school 
                collaborations to not only increase the college's environmental 
                awareness and sustainability but that of the wider community as well.</p>
            <p>The Nelson College Environmental Committee is a future-focused committee. 
                We focus on ensuring that the environment is nurtured not only in the 
                present but also in the future. We make sure that Nelson College 
                maintains sustainable practices to minimise our impact on the environment 
                and to improve the environmental awareness of our students. The Nelson 
                College Environmental Committee is necessary in ensuring that the 
                students of Nelson College are aware of their impact and take 
                environmental action to reduce not only their own, but that of others. 
                Spreading further awareness, and further action.</p>
