            <p>The Nelson College Environmental Committee currently has two active initiatives 
                that continue to be maintained and improved. We are always looking to improve 
                existing initiatives or create new ones. If you or someone you know have ideas, 
                do not hesitate to reach out, and we will try to make changes or implement new 
                initiatives if we agree they are necessary.<br /> <span class="subtext">Find

            <!-- Tree Planting sub heading -->
            <h2>Tree Planting</h2>
            <!-- Tree Planting text content -->
            <p>The tree planting initiative was started in 2015, with an aim to increase the 
                biodiversity of Nelson College and the surrounding Grampians. It involves the 
                planting of native flora on the bank of the top field, and the bank located 
                near the old nursery of the Committee. This initiative has seen much success in 
                recent years, with many new members joining to help contribute to our biodiversity 
                efforts. In 2023, our members collaborated with the Nelson College for Girls Environmental 
                Committee, which resulted in a significant increase in planted trees. The top 
                field bank now has an estimated 200-300 trees planted, while the old nursery 
                bank has 25-75. </p>
            <p>This initiative is necessary to reduce the footprint of Nelson College and its 
                students. It allows for collaboration between Nelson College and other schools, 
                and gets the students involved in a meaningful initiative that will bring 
                positive change for the future. Unfortunately, with the sale of the Nelson 
                College Outdoor Education block, the Nelson College Environmental Committee 
                has lost its plant nursery. Although this is a significant setback to the 
                initiative's progress, we will continue to maintain the already planted trees while 
                researching the possibility of a new nursery location. In 2024, there will 
                be a large reduction in tree planting, but if funding is acquired, we should 
                be able to plant some more trees before the end of the year.</p>

            <!-- Recycling sub heading -->
            <h2>Recycling</h2>
            <!-- Recycling text content -->
            <p>The recycling initiative was created at the end of 2023. Its aim is to improve 
                the awareness of Nelson College students regarding what can and cannot be 
                recycled. This initiative is also needed to create the infrastructure necessary 
                for a long-lasting recycling program. </p>
            <p>The bins were provided by Paper4Trees, an organisation that gives trees to 
                participating schools when they recycle. Combining these bins with posters 
                created by the Committee means that recycling is now more easily understood 
                by Nelson College students and will allow for more steadfast infrastructure to 
                be present at the school. This initiative will allow the Committee to gain more 
                trees to plant, which will contribute to the tree planting initiative. It will 
                also increase the amount of recycling we do, which will subsequently reduce 
                the amount of waste we contribute to landfill.</p>

            <!-- Upcoming Initiatives sub heading -->
            <h2>Upcoming Initiatives</h2>
            <!-- Upcoming Initiatives text content -->
            <p>The Nelson College Environmental Committee is working on two new initiatives, which
                 will be rolled out in 2024. 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The first is a <strong>pest control initiative</strong>. A pest control initiative has been 
                        previously run by the Committee but has been inactive over the past 2 years. 
                        This initiative is being reintroduced to reduce the number of small pests, such 
                        as rats and mice, and to investigate the small animals surrounding the college. 
                        The initiative will utilise our existing Victor rat traps and ink tunnels. 
                        These traps are successfully used by the 
                        <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.brooksanctuary.org.nz/" target="_blank">Brook WaimƒÅrama Sanctuary</a> 
                        and <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.birdlifeongrampians.org.nz/" target="_blank">Birdlife on Grampians</a> 
                        organisations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The second is a <strong>composting initiative</strong>. This initiative is being introduced 
                        to allow the school to reduce the amount of organic waste being sent to landfill, 
                        and instead divert it to be used in a sustainable practice. The compost 
                        produced from this initiative will then be used with our tree planting 
                        initiative to allow the trees to gain fresh soil, which will promote the growth 
                        and survival of the trees. This initiative will start in collaboration with 
                        the Nelson College food technology classes. Once the initiative has gained 
                        traction and has been refined for maximum efficiency, the Committee will 
                        investigate the possibility of compost collection throughout the school.
