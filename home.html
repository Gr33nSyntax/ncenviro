            <p>Nelson College is an official Enviroschool. As an Enviroschool, we must all strive to ensure that the 
                school follows the five key principles of Enviroschools:</p><br />
            <p class="key_principles_1">The school must <strong>contribute meaningfully within the community</strong>,
            forming connections between students, their community, and their environment.</p>
            <p class="key_principles_2">The school must <strong>teach sustainable ideas and practices</strong> to promote 
            future-focused learning and ensure all aspects of the local and global environment are addressed.</p>
            <p class="key_principles_3">When the school takes action, it must be <strong>guided by</strong> the history, 
            knowledge, tikanga, traditions, and aspirations of the <strong>local hapÅ«.</strong></p>
            <p class="key_principles_4">The school must <strong>foster, respect, and celebrate diversity</strong> and all 
            forms of identity. Nelson College should be a safe place for all to learn and flourish 
            equally.</p>
            <p class="key_principles_5">The school must act in such a way that <strong>all aspects of nature are 
            nurtured in the present and future</strong>. Through collaboration, we can ensure that we create a 
            safe, healthy, and thriving community for all to share equally. </p>

            <p>By joining the Nelson College Environmental Committee, not only are you making yourself more aware of the 
                many branches of environmentalism, but you will also ensure that Nelson College meets the key principles 
                of Enviroschools, which will result in a positive, greener, and more sustainable future for our school, 
                the community, and humanity as a whole. You will also be helping us navigate towards a Bronze 
                Enviroschool status, which will show that we are making progress in the right direction and prove our

            <p>Our members not only learn hands-on and practical skills but are also given unique and incredible 
                opportunities, both in and out of the school, to make environmental change. Join the committee to 
                partake in these opportunities and ensure a brighter future for all.</p>
